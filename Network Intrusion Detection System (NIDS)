Certainly! Below is a basic README template for presenting your Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) code:

Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
Overview
This is a simple Python-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats. The system uses the scapy library for packet sniffing, allowing it to analyze packets and detect various types of network traffic.

Features
Packet Sniffing: Monitors network traffic on a specified interface.
TCP and UDP Analysis: Identifies TCP and UDP packets, including source and destination ports.
HTTP and HTTPS Detection: Flags potential HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
External Agent Monitoring: Tracks external IP addresses communicating with the network.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
scapy library (pip install scapy)
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone "https://github.com/yourusername/nids.git"
cd nids
Install dependencies:

bash

pip install scapy
Run the NIDS:

bash
Copy code
python nids.py
Make sure to replace eth0 with your actual network interface.

View the log:

The NIDS logs events to nids_log.txt for future analysis.

Customization
Interface: Change the interface variable in the main function to match your network interface.
Internal IP Ranges: Update the internal_ranges list in the internal_ips method to define your internal IP address range(s).
Additional Notes
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to capture packets on the specified network interface.
Respect legal and ethical considerations when monitoring network traffic.
Future Improvements
Implement more advanced packet analysis and threat detection.
Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds.
Enhance logging and reporting features.
